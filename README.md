Prework at the Flatiron School

In this project, I reflect on my journey as a student learning Software Engineering, 
focusing on the foundational concepts introduced during the prework sessions.
 This includes mastering key tools and languages such as the Command Line Interface (CLI), HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each of these sections played an integral role in shaping my understanding of web development and programming fundamentals. The project highlights my growth as I progressed through each stage, from simple command line operations to building dynamic and responsive web pages.

The project not only showcases technical skills but also my personal excitement and curiosity throughout the learning process. 
My favorite moments include discovering how to manipulate the DOM using JavaScript, styling websites with CSS to create visually appealing layouts, and utilizing the CLI to streamline workflows.
 This experience has given me a strong foundation in full-stack development, and I am eager to apply these skills in future projects and challenges.
